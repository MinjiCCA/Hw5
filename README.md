You were walking past an apartment and suddenly saw some coins falling from the two windows.
This game, ‘Steal Coins!’, is to collect the falling coins as much as you can and when you miss one, the game ends.
You can use left and right arrow keys to control the player to the left and right.
Whenever the player touches the falling coin, there would be a sound effect that indicates that the player collected the coin.
